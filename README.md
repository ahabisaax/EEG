# EEG

This repository involves training a binary classifier  to accurately discern confusion in students, 
leveraging EEG brainwave data features including attention, gamma, and theta."

Attention:
In computational neuroscience, 
Attention refers to how the brain selects and processes specific information while ignoring other inputs. It's like a neural mechanism that lets us focus on relevant details while filtering out distractions.

Mediation:
meditation can be seen as a process that influences neural activity patterns. It's like running a special program in the brain's "software" that alters the way neurons interact, leading to changes in cognitive states.

Raw Data:
Raw data in computational neuroscience is akin to the digital signals captured directly from brain measurements. It's like the initial stream of binary code that needs processing to extract meaningful information. This could involve filtering noise and identifying patterns.

Frequency Bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma):
brain waves are analyzed as oscillations in neural activity. Different frequency bands correspond to different patterns of neural firing. For instance:

Delta: Models might simulate slow oscillations during deep sleep using low-frequency patterns.
Theta: Computational models could explore how theta waves enhance memory and learning during tasks like navigation.
Alpha: Understanding alpha waves might involve modeling the brain's self-regulation during rest or idle states.
Beta: Computational studies could investigate beta oscillations' role in motor control or cognitive processing.
Gamma: Models might simulate gamma oscillations during complex tasks, like perception and decision-making.
Think of these frequency bands as computational patterns that help simulate and understand various brain functions.

These terms offer insights into how computational neuroscience researchers analyze brain activity, they act as salient features and so one can use them to build models to simulate neural processes or predict human behaviour.
